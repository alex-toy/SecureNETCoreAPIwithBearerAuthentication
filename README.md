# SecureNETCoreAPIwithBearerAuthentication

In this project, we will see how to secure a .NET Core API with JWT Bearer Authentication, using Azure Active Directory as the Identity and Access Management Layer,  how to write a “secure” API client to call and authenticate to the secured API endpoint. We will use the *Microsoft.Identity.Client* and *Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer* packages amongst others.
